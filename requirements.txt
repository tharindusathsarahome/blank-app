numpy  # Often a dependency of PyTorch/Torchvision, good to include
Pillow==11.2.1
# For PyTorch with CUDA 12.4 (GPU support)
# If your Streamlit Cloud environment has a GPU, this is preferred.
# However, most free tiers of Streamlit Cloud do NOT provide GPUs.

# --- OR (More common and recommended for Streamlit Cloud free tier) ---
# For PyTorch CPU-only (generally more reliable for cloud deployment without dedicated GPUs)
